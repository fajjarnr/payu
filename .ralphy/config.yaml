# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
rules:
  - "Core Banking (Java): Use Spring Boot 3.4.x, Java 21, and Hexagonal Architecture."
  - "Supporting Services: Use Quarkus 3.x for native compilation compatibility."
  - "ML/Analytics: Use FastAPI and Python 3.12 (UBI-based)."
  - "Database: Use PostgreSQL (standard SQL) and JSONB for document-like data."
  - "Events: Use AMQ Streams (Kafka) for event-driven logic."
  - "Testing: Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor). Use Testcontainers for integration tests."
  - "Git: Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor)."
  - "Lifecycle: Update CHANGELOG.md for any significant code changes."
  - "Documentation: Always use Context7 MCP to query latest Spring/Quarkus/Kafka documentation before implementing."
  - "Infrastucture: Prioritize Red Hat UBI9 (Universal Base Image) for all Dockerfiles. If UBI9 is unavailable or incompatible, use standard Alpine or Debian-slim as alternative and report it."
  - "Performance: Before running E2E tests or Docker Compose, always perform a host-level pre-build using `mvn clean package -DskipTests -T 1C` in the backend root to warm up Maven cache and speed up the process."

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify

    - ".git/**"

    - "**/build/**"
    - "**/*.lock"
    - "**/node_modules/**"
