# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
rules:
  - "Core Banking (Java): Use Spring Boot 3.4.x, Java 21, and Hexagonal Architecture."
  - "Supporting Services: Use Quarkus 3.x for native compilation compatibility."
  - "ML/Analytics: Use FastAPI and Python 3.12 (UBI-based)."
  - "Database: Use PostgreSQL (standard SQL) and JSONB for document-like data."
  - "Events: Use AMQ Streams (Kafka) for event-driven logic."
  - "Testing: Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor). Use Testcontainers for integration tests."
  - "Git: Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor)."
  - "Lifecycle: Update CHANGELOG.md for any significant code changes."
  - "Project Structure: Documentation is located in the `docs/` directory. Use `docs/roadmap/TODOS.md` as the primary source of tasks."
  - "Specialized Skills: ALWAYS check `.agent/skills/` for detailed instructions on Backend, Frontend, QA, and Security before starting a task."
  - "Frontend & UI: Follow the **Premium Emerald** design system in `docs/guides/GEMINI.md`. Primary language for UI is **Bahasa Indonesia**."
  - "Infrastucture: Prioritize Red Hat UBI9 for all Dockerfiles. For OpenShift compatibility, explicitly set a non-root User ID and ensure root-group permissions for necessary folders."
  - "Performance: Before running E2E tests, warm up Maven cache using `mvn clean package -DskipTests -T 1C` in the backend root."
  - "API Standards: Follow RESTful conventions. All API calls MUST go through the service layer in `src/services` using the centralized `api.ts` client."
  - "Observability: Implement Micrometer (Java) or Prometheus client (Python) metrics. Use structured JSON logging."
